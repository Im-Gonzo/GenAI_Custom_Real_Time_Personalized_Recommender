    "# ðŸ§¬ Training pipeline: Training retrieval model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will train a retrieval model that will be able to quickly generate a small subset of candidate items from a large collection of items. Your model will be based on the *two-tower architecture*, which embeds queries and candidates (keys) into a shared low-dimensional vector space. Here, a query consists of features of a customer and a transaction (e.g. timestamp of the purchase), whereas a candidate consists of features of a particular item. All queries will have a user ID and all candidates will have an item ID, and the model will be trained such that the embedding of a user will be close to all the embeddings of items the user has previously bought.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training the model you will save and upload its components to the Vertex AI Model Registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go ahead and load the data."
